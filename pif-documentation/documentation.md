Controlling tempo of TidalCycles from MPU6050, using Link to sync the tempo.

The x-acc, y-acc, z-acc are given by the sensor. These are converted to the r-acc, 

r = sqrt ( a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2) 

BUT perhaps this gives less agency for the people using the sensor (hat/suit) as all dimensions are being used together?

* which sensor is picking up repetition (the most)?
* pulse detection from smallest peak to affect the rhythm (shortest cycles)
* pattern from the longer cycle
* drums emerging (from noise) when repetitive detected 
* people move to meter, not to syncopation
* pattern from hat? hands? or feet?
* visualisation (y/p/r) but for the programmers and not the audience (yet)
